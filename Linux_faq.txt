Are "GNU/Linux" and "Linux" any different?
You keep referring to one and the other alternatively. What is this all about?
Originally, Linux refers to a core component (called the kernel) that fits within the GNU system. What users run today are, to be precise, "distributions of the GNU/Linux system".

In practice, the word "Linux" caught on much better (unsurprisingly), and today people refer to the whole system as simply "Linux". This causes a great deal of controversy.

Calling the system GNU/Linux is much more meaningful, technically (end-users use a lot of "GNU" and a little of "Linux") but also philosophically: the strength and momentum of the Free Software movement started with and are still carried by the GNU project.

Calling the system Linux is more practical and appealing for computer users that often believe Windows is the only thing on earth.

To avoid confusion, we use "GNU/Linux" to refer to operating system distributions that include GNU software and the Linux kernel. When we use "Linux" without the GNU part, we refer to the kernel.
